# Agility iteration XLS to text

Tired of dealing with XLS files from the `iteration scheduling` from Agility (aka versionone). Converts the exported iteration Excel file into a simple text that you can copy and send to your manager.

## Run

```bash
./iteration-xls-to-text path/to/Backlog_for-36.xls
```


## Build

```bash
odin build .
```
